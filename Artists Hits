First in create two seperate tables. "One for the artists" and "one for the songs the artists have written".

CREATE TABLE famouspeople (id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
fullname TEXT,
AGE INTEGER);

INSERT INTO famouspeople (fullname, age) VALUES ("Beyonce","40");
INSERT INTO famouspeople (fullname, age) VALUES ("Rihanna", "35");
INSERT INTO famouspeople (fullname, age) VALUES ("Drake", "32");
INSERT INTO famouspeople (fullname, age) VALUES ("Desiigner", "25");
INSERT INTO famouspeople (fullname, age) VALUES ("Wizkid","30");
INSERT INTO famouspeople(fullname, age) VALUES ("Davido", "32");
INSERT INTO famouspeople(fullname, age) VALUES ("Tiwa Savage", "35");


Create TABLE songs (id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
person_id INTEGER,
name TEXT);

INSERT INTO songs (person_id, name) VALUES (1, "If i were a boy");
INSERT INTO songs (person_id, name) VALUES (2, "Umbrella");
INSERT INTO songs (person_id, name) VALUES (3, "Come closer");
INSERT INTO songs (person_id, name) VALUES (4, "Panda");
INSERT INTO songs (person_id, name)
VALUES (5, "Essence");
INSERT INTO songs (person_id, name) VALUES (6, "Aye");
INSERT INTO songs (person_id, name) VALUES (7,"Koroba");

After that I have created an INNER Joint to combine both tables together, to create a nice human readable list.

SELECT f.fullname, s.name
FROM famouspeople AS f
INNER JOIN songs as s
ON f.id=s.person_id;
